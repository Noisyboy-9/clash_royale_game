In spring 2020, in [Amirkabir University of Technology](aut.ac.ir), for advanced programming class, the students were
tasked to create a simpler version of [Clash Royal Game](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/) using javafx, and
java-core. <br>

## 3D client

In this project we tried to use 3D elements to make the UI better, and also make the game much more similar to the main
game. some screenshots of the main game area: <br>

## Online Game

In this project we tried to implement online mode using a command caster server that receives commands from clients and
broadcasts it between all clients.

## UML design

The design that we did for the game can be found
